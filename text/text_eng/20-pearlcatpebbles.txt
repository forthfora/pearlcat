This is an old conversation between myself and a close friend who I considered a mentor.

We have... Not spoken for a very long time now. I can't in my current state. Even if I could, I still cannot bring myself to do so.

None of them understood my theories, but Suns, they trusted me. They risked so much trying to help me, and I<LINE>hurt them. It's only now, after I've had so much time to think on it, that I understand why I was so angry.

I lashed out, because out of everyone, they were the last individual I wanted to confront me about my mistakes...

I can't go back now.

All I can do is hope they have met a better fate.
