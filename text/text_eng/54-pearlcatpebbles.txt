This is a genome for a purposed organism. Just a menial cleaning slug.

I would guess, with the simple structures present,<LINE>and lack of mechanical interchange glands, that this blueprint is extremely old.

This creature would be much closer to a domesticated animal, compared to the (relatively) newer<LINE>and specialized organisms produced with more modern techniques. A being made to<LINE>live its life inside a metal pipe deep underground has no need for eyes after all.

In the same way, my own body is all around you. Composed of specialized organisms,<LINE>and machinery. What you see in front of you is only the tiny extremity of a<LINE>colossal presence. A pressence  fatally merged with his own failures.
