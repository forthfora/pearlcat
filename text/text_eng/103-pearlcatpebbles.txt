You took this from within the city? These are architectural notes from the original construction of my facility.

The notes entail plans for bridges that connect two of my legs to those of my neighbor's, Looks to the Moon.<LINE>This particular configuration between two iterators is quite unique, and very peculiar. It is a rare<LINE>occurrence for two iterators to be located this close to each other.

During the time period of these plans, solutions were being drafted to allow for a mass migration of<LINE>citizens out of Moon's city. With how inhospitable the surface had become, attempting to escort an<LINE>entire city's populace across the ground over any length of distance would have been disastrous.

These connecting bridges served as a high-altitude evacuation route that could facilitate safe transit from her city to mine.

I can only hope the destruction of the bridges during her collapse<LINE>prevented my current unfortunate situation from spreading to her.

These are my mistakes to endure, not hers.
