Ah, you found this in the memory crypts? I would advise against wandering into such<LINE>secure areas. The memory crypts were considered sacred ground by my creators.

The memories and wealth of entire family houses were laid to rest within, and their destruction or theft<LINE>by surface creatures was considered abhorrent. As such, the crypts are guarded by extremely durable and<LINE>aggressive purposed organisms.

It was customary to enshrine all material possessions and memories to the crypts on one's ascent.<LINE>None of these qualia are present in my logs, and many of these may have found some use in my archives.
