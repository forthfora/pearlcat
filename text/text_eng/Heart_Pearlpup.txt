<CapPlayerName>... this one pulses warmly...

I am not so sure this is a data pearl - its appearance is so vastly different from any I have seen before.

And its contents are difficult to make out, a complex tangle of emotions perhaps...?

Ah... some pearls contain a feeling, rather than words, it's hard to describe them... but this one...

Maybe you should return this to where you found it, <PlayerName>, I feel it had some importance or purpose, beyond just data or sentimentality.

I can only assume that it beared the same importance to its previous owner...
