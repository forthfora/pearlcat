This is an old conversation log between my nearby peers. They were concerned about my goal for personal ascension.<LINE>Although they were unaware it was me at the time, as my conversations on that topic were anonymous.

It was... disappointing to me that they refused to understand. I did not believe they could even comprehend,<LINE>as it is not supposed to be within our design to do so.

Perhaps it was for the best.

. . .

But still, should we reject a way out of this maze, on the mere principle that escape itself is forbidden?

Should we discard Sliver of Straw too? For the sake of our creator's mandate?
