It's a conversation log, all plain text. Not a comfortable one for me. Still, I will read it.

"1681.662 - PRIVATE<LINE>Seven Red Suns, Chasing Wind

CW: Have you had any contact with Five Pebbles recently?

SRS: Not in a long while actually! Unless worrying about him counts.

CW: One of his neighbors, Unparalleled Innocence, sent an overseer to his can and got some images.<LINE>They were made public in the local group, in an effort to be mean I suppose.<LINE>There's no other way of putting it - he looks awful.

SRS: Tell me.

CW: He's got the rot, very badly. Big cysts have become mobile and are scattering down the west and middle legs.<LINE>He does listen to you, and few others by now, so you should talk to him.

SRS: I will try to contact him. Does Moon know?

CW: Moon has been unavailable for some time."

I have no use for being spiteful anymore. It is apparent to me now that they were trying to help, in their own way.

I did not see so clearly back then.
