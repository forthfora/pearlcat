This is a microbial log from the waste department. Or what's left of it now.

There are pieces of myself down there, corrupted and rotting away. I do not advise you to look for what remains of<LINE>them. Although the cysts are largely incapable of surviving for long periods outside of my superstructure, the sheer amount of material is not to be taken lightly.

The damage to my structure is already severe, and it will only get worse - a good reason to stay out of my memory arrays, don't you think?
