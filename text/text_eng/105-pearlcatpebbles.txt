This is a microbial log from the waste department. Or what's left of it now.

There are pieces of myself down there, corrupted and rotting away. I do not advise you to look for what remains of<LINE>them. Although the cysts are largely incapable of surviving for long periods outside of my superstructure, the sheer amount of material is not to be taken lightly.

It has been countless cycles since I have seen past this chamber. I can only imagine the damage inflicted on my structure itself at this point.

It is only a matter of time before my collapse.
