This one has not been archived. It was likely transported by hand...

It is a message of political discourse regarding concerns about the increasingly<LINE>tense relationship between myself and the various Houses. This part is amusing.

"I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction! They have less than forty members on the Council, but still Tilt<LINE>the spiritual Discourse with Our Iterator in a direction that most obviously Displeases him,<LINE>and is hardly High Held by anyone in the Community either! We can not Risk this!"

It is no secret that my construction was a point of great controversy. Many council members worked vehemently<LINE>to prevent me from ever coming into being. Their stance was so unfaltering that even after construction was<LINE>complete, a number of Houses still denied transfer and remained behind in her city out of protest.

This rift caused frequent feuds and tensions amongst the community. Those of the opposition<LINE>would never yield to those who supported the so called "Apostate Superstructure Abomination".<LINE>But to say I found their actions displeasing? Not quite.

While certainly more violent and disruptive, they at least provided me interesting cognitive<LINE>challenges to use my time on. As opposed to the endless rituals and pleasantries of the monks<LINE>of my own Houses, which I found to be the most wearisome of all.
