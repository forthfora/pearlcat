This is an archival text, from before the Green hegemonic linguistic dynasty's second revelation.

The text itself is an early tome of hymns and spiritual guidance. Forming an early<LINE>understanding of the five natural urges that bind oneself to the cycle. As is to be<LINE>expected from text of this era, it is washed in metaphor and symbolism.

Although my kind was built for pragmatism, I have always had a fondness for my creator's history.<LINE>The first iterators, during the golden age of the void fluid revolution, lived through the<LINE>metamorphosis of scripture and verse into the first age of understanding...

To be created in, or experience such an age is something I greatly envied!

Thank you, wet mouse.
