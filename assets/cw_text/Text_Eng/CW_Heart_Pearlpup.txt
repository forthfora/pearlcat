What is this? It's pulsing...

I doubt this is a data pearl, despite its outwards appearance.

If I were to hazard a guess, it would be that it is just a small component of a greater system - the inner workings are rather complex.

...it feels oddly wrong to be holding this, as if it once served a very important function.

Please keep it... perhaps even return it to where you found it, if it isn't too much trouble?

Ah, I suppose it would only be sentimental. In its current state, I can't imagine it would be much use to anyone anymore.
