Hello there! You are a hard one to miss.

I have something to ask... have you been here before?

There is something quite familiar about your presence.

A creature with the ability to manipulate pearls...? I wouldn't forget that, but surely...

...ah sorry, I shouldn't get caught up in malfunctioning memory arrays. You are welcome to visit anytime!

And given your talents, I do hope you find the time to visit me often; I'd be more than happy to read those pearls of yours for you.

I have to admit, you leave me with so many questions about your biology, but I won't pry.

Well, I suppose that's about it from me - I bid you good luck on your travels!

...it was a red-cloaked creature... but didn't they have a child...? How could I forget these details...
