Oh, be careful with this one! It appears to be a focus, for directing energy to a fine point.

If I were to guess, maybe it played some role in a laser focusing mechanism? Hard to say.

It doesn't match any schematics I have on record however, so perhaps it isn't some misplaced component after all.

Either way, pay attention to where you point this thing; unless you fancy losing an eye, of course!
