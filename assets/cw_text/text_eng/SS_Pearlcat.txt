Oh, this pearl was made very recently, I think! It's still warm...
It seems to have been made with some care, the structure is particularly clean.
Five Pebbles' craftsmanship, if I were to guess? It would only make sense given his relative proximity.
Back when the communication networks were functioning properly, he would occassionaly share his work - pearl formation being one of his hobbies.
I must admit, it is fufilling to finally see one in-person, evidently he hasn't lost his passion for cultural archiving, even after all this time.
If I recall correctly, he also took pride in hiding little messages within these... at least that is what Moon would say.
As far as I can tell this one is blank, though I never had an eye for details like Moon did...
