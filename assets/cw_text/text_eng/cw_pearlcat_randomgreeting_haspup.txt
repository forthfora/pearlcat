Hi. If you have anything you need reading, I'll be right here... you know, just a reminder.

Hey, just passing through? If you have anything to show me, I could help pass the time.

Welcome, I hope the trek through my structure isn't too much of a hassle... sad to say it deters a lot of visitors.

Hi, anything for me to see? I'm sure I'd have something to say about it!

Hi. If you have anything you need reading, I'll be right here.

Welcome back. Things are pretty slow these days - a visit from you two is certainly the highlight of any cycle!

Hello again! You two are more than welcome to stay - especially if you have something to show me.

How is the little one? I can only imagine the stress of parenting in a world like this... glad to see them safe.
