I remember this being a working memory - raw data would been dropped here in order to later be<LINE>pasted to a currently occupied memory conflux. Safe to assume this was part of a menial task I was doing.

This one portrays a moment: a wall climbing lizard stares up into the branches of a big tree.<LINE>The last part is overwritten by some number sequence,<LINE>it is vaguely familiar. I must have been in the process of another futile iteration before declaring the whole thing pointless.

A standard prayer mantra repeated exactly 7110 times. Each iteration has some subtle variation, it could<LINE>poetically summarize our struggle to a simple creature like you, I suppose.

It's an image of a single grey cloud, hovering above a surface of white clouds under a deep blue sky.

Two intertwined number series. This had a variety of applications for me back then, namely keeping data secure.<LINE>It has done its job, without adequate context, I cannot use this to decrypt anything.

It's qualia; someone is holding a black stone, and twisting it slightly as they drag their finger across the<LINE>rough surface. It's incredibly short, with an incredibly high resolution.

A working memory. Having long lost the context, I couldn't say what its purpose would be. The segment of my<LINE>memory conflux I would have read this from is in total disrepair.

Just a working memory, at my... height, I would have had inconceivable amounts of these running in parallel.

A small part of a greater whole surrounding the Void Fluid simulation. Far too complex for you to understand,<LINE>even if I did have the capacity and context to explain it in my current state.

To explain it simply, this one has been overwritten by a negative version of itself for countless iterations.<LINE>The result is a blank slate, with no hope of recovering the information it once held.<LINE>I must have been handling some very sensitive data.

A vivid memory - it is hard to explain in a way you will understand - it is what one would typically associate with<LINE>standing in a warm wind, but not the physical feeling, rather the notion.<LINE>Unlike my younger self, I don't suppose you would be needing this for fringe Regeneraist research?
