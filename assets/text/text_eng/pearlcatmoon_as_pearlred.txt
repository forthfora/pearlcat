<CapPlayerName>, what a peculiar find!

It almost appears this pearl's structure has been finely tuned, not for data storage, but as a focus.

Any energy put in seems to be localized to a very fine point - how curious...

Given the right input, it could prove quite dangerous, I would imagine!

Ah, be careful out there, <PlayerName>...
