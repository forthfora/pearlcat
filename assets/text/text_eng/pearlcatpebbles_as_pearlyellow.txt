Interesting, a self healing pearl.

As I'm sure you don't know, much of the world was built with time in mind - many structures have the ability to repair themselves, typically through biological means.

I have not seen the same demonstrated with a pearl until now, however.

I would like to study this one further... though none of it really matters now, I suppose.
