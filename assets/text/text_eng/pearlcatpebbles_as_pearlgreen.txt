This pearl appears to be some kind of encoded mantra, but unlike one I have ever seen.

A mantra typically contains a brief pattern of numbers, often used for symbolic purposes. This one appears to have a pattern at first, but never repeats. A thread with no start and no end.

A curious find to be sure, but a rather odd one.

Could you possibly leave this one? Something compels me to investigate it further.
