This is a production log from a facility on the surface. It has been a very long time since I've cared about<LINE>reading one, although I suppose I have little else I can do in my current state.

The name... roughly translates as Side House. I remember the shipments of holy ash I used to receive from there.

I don't know how I would gain access to holy ash in the present day, not that I have much use for it. Despite all the<LINE>independent power of my machinery, the relationship I had with my creators was a mutually symbiotic one.

I was built to provide for them, but there was also much I relied on them to provide for me.

Their absence has made things harder, but there is still much to do.
