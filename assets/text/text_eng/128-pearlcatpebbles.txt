Oh. This is from the old drill site north of the farm array. It's quite ancient, as the mines predate my construction.

The early ages of the Void Fluid revolution were an explosive period of innovation and industry. By creating a<LINE>vacuum of empty space, and inducing a flux in the energy fields around the singular null point you've created,<LINE>you can cause a fuel mass of base elements to decompose into energy. This process is called mass rarefaction.

Of course, this undertaking required extremely pure samples to properly craft rarefaction cells. Older mines on the<LINE>surface became abandoned once underground construction became much easier. Though, most nearby systems were connected<LINE>anyway, regardless of age or depth. Void Fluid isn't exactly easy to purify, or even properly contain.

The pearl itself is simply a maintenance and production log for one of the forty-seven operating drill silos. I cannot say how many still remain.
