This is clearly not a data pearl, rather a purposed organic augment. An incredibly complex one at that.

I am not a medical facility, but if I had to guess, it is designed to replicate the functions of several vital organs.

Whoever this was made for must have been on the very edge of death - perhaps it is safe to say they are past that now.

You can keep this if you want, it has long served its purpose.
