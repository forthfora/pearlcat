Oh, how interesting. A pearl that was made very recently.

Judging by the traces of sulfur in its lattice, I can only summise that Grey Wind gifted you this.

Their systems must be overrun by sulfur contamination; it could only be from the nearby wellspring leaking into the supply aquifier.

It seems the choice to build there was a poor one - not something my creators were all too concerned about, clearly.

Oh? It appears to contain a ritualistic hymn from our creators... from before our time - you cannot comprehend how valuable this is!

. . .

...alright, you can have this back now, I have already copied its contents to my personal collection.

I wonder how many more of these cultural artefacts Wind has kept from me... you wouldn't happen to have another of these, would you?
