<CapPlayerName>, something is rather unsettling about this pearl.

The surface is covered in micro-scratches - but there are even more that have... healed?

I hope you weren't the one that made them? There are better things to gnaw on, I'm sure!

But... that wouldn't explain...

Ah, I am probably overthinking things. Unfortunately there is no data to be gleaned from this pearl. Not in its current state.
