This pearl appears to contain a mantra for health and good fortune - how taboo!

Trinkets promoting longevity such as this one were often viewed as a form of self-preservation, so were largely outlawed by our time.

I can't imagine where you found this; though I suppose it isn't too surprising that things like this could slip through the cracks.

We all have our doubts over the effectiveness of these charms - iterators are known for their pragmatism, after all.

...but I must admit, something about holding this is rather comforting.
